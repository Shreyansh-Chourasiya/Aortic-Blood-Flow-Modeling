# Aortic-Blood-Flow-Modeling
Aortic Blood Flow using the Windkissel Model [Prof. Atul Bhargav]

◦ Simulated a Mathematical Model for Blood Flow through the Aorta.

◦ Python program that takes heart readings as Input and provides the heart’s efficiency, systole/diastole pressure, blood flow rate, and percentage error in each value at an input time.

◦ Used Graphical Data to analyze the way by which we can improve the efficiency of the system.
